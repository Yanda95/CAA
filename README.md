## 🧠 Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in **voice-based interactive systems**, yet little is known about their **robustness to audio attacks**.  
**CAA (Chat-Audio Attacks)** is the first benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs against **diverse audio-based adversarial threats**, covering both **content-based** and **emotion-based** manipulations.

CAA offers:
- ⚔️ **1760 high-quality audio adversarial samples**
- 🎯 Attacks on **response quality** rather than just transcription
- 📊 Evaluation on popular LLMs including **GPT-4o**, **Qwen2-Audio**, **SALMONN**, and more
